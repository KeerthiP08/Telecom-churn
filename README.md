# Predicting Telecom Churn with Random Forest

**Objective:** The main objective is to utilize advanced machine learning techniques to identify potential customer churn. This allows telecom companies to take proactive measures, enhancing customer retention and overall satisfaction.   
**Importance:** In the competitive world of telecom, retaining customers is key to business success. By predicting which customers might leave, companies can tailor their customer service and promotional efforts to keep them engaged.   
**Approach:** This project will walk you through approach from data collection and preprocessing to model training and evaluation. The aim is to provide actionable insights that telecom companies can use to reduce their turnover rates. In this approach we use Random Forest algorithm.    
**Expectation:** In the project, weâ€™ll understand how model can predict customer behavior and how it can be implemented to improve business strategies in the telecom sector.
